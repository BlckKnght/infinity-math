Infinity Math Dev Plan

v0: Do nothing, just have a site that loads dynamically.

v1: Simple form for BS only: Enter modified BS, B, modified damage, get results in a chart

v2: Slightly better form: Different kinds of tests (normal, ftf, etc). Modifiers are separated from attributes.

v3: Better Math: Handle special ammo types, guts rolls, form uses full model profile

v4: Stored model profiles in DB, asks for modifiers only

v5: Everything is stored. Weapons, range brackets, other modifiers are all handled with drop downs

v6: N vs M dice? Localization/i18n? Requests from the forum?
