Infinity Math Dev Plan

v0: Do nothing, just have a site that loads dynamically.

v1: Simple form for BS only: Enter modified BS, B, modified damage, get results in a chart

v2: Slightly better form: Modifiers are separated from attributes

v3: Better Math: Handle special ammo types

v4: Different kinds of tests (normal, ftf, etc).

v5: Stored model profiles in DB, asks for modifiers only

v7: Everything is stored. Weapons, range brackets, other modifiers are all handled with drop downs

v8: N vs M dice? Localization/i18n? Requests from the forum?
